Model:
Model testing is done in ipynb named TFT-TEST and LSTM and GRU
Annotations about the TFT model are mainly in the TFT-TEST file,
Other TFT model files have no annotations except for the loss function part
LSTM and GRU codes are very similar, and the annotations are all in LSTM
TFT-loss-Spearman is the loss function part of the Spearman correlation coefficient
TFT-loss-MDA is the MDA loss function part
TFT-GradNorm is the part that uses the GradNorm method to automate weights
TFT-model-weights.pth is the saved model weights

Data:
NVD A, AAPL, TSLA are the data abbreviations of the three companies
-5y suffix represents 5 years of pure stock data
_data suffix represents the addition of financial data
-AI suffix represents the addition of social keyword popularity data

Logs:
Lightning_logs saves some logs left during the training process
.lr_find_93ad9c46-f78d-46b2-a19b-1e8f988256f8.ckpt：is the log file of optimization parameters
.ipynb_checkpoints：Automatically save the checkpoints of the notebook
